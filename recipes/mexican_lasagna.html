          <h1>Mexican Lasagna - No Lasagna Noodles!</h1>

          <div class="description">
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
              This is a traditional dish in my family. Anyone can make it
              really. It is composed of traditional Mexican ingredients layered
              over the top of one another in a lasagna-like fashion (hence the
              name) but has little similarity to lasagna, so lasagna haters have
              no fear!

            <h2>Directions</h2>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>
                  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a
                  9x13-inch casserole dish.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>
                  Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in ground
                  beef. Cook and stir until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and
                  no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess
                  grease. Add water and taco seasoning; cook and stir until
                  mixture has thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>

                <p>
                  Arrange 3 tortillas in the bottom of the casserole dish;
                  spread about half the can of refried beans and half the ground
                  beef atop the tortilla layer. Sprinkle 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese
                  over ground beef layer. Arrange 3 more tortillas over the
                  cheese. Spread in the remaining 1/2 can refried beans and half
                  the jar of taco sauce; sprinkle with 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese.
                  Arrange 3 more tortillas and top with remaining ground beef
                  and 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese. Top with last 3 tortillas and
                  remaining 1/2 jar taco sauce.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h3>Step 4</h3>

                <p>
                  Bake in the preheated oven until top tortilla layer begins to
                  brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese over
                  lasagna.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h3>Step 5</h3>
                <p>Turn on oven's broiler.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h3>Step 6</h3>
                <p>
                  Place lasagna under the broiler until Colby-Jack cheese is
                  melted and bubbling, 3 to 5 minutes.
                </p>
